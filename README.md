# lol-queue-dodger

I take no credits for this, I just ported it to a more friendly (read less prone to ban for 3rd party app) form.
Riot may be able to detect the usage of this and punish you in the future, so You've been warned.

Requires NodeJS, download at: https://nodejs.org/
Usage: run from command prompt -> node lol-queue-dodger.js "PATH TO lockfile"
exemple: node lol-queue-dodger.js "C:\Games\Riot Games\League of Legends\lockfile"

Run the script and you will be sent to TFT Tutorial, skipping the queue without LP loss or LeaveBuster.
Wait till the tutorial starts and press ESC and Surrender to get back to the client, all done.
