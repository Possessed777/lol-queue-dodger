# lol-queue-dodger

NO LONGER WORKING (PATCH 11.12), if you have a new method, feel free to share.

I take no credits for this.

Riot may be able to detect the usage of this and punish you in the future, so You've been warned.

NodeJS Version:
Requires NodeJS, download at: https://nodejs.org/

Usage: run from command prompt -> node lol-queue-dodger.js "PATH TO lockfile" 

exemple: node lol-queue-dodger.js "C:\Games\Riot Games\League of Legends\lockfile" 

Run the script and you will be sent to TFT Tutorial, skipping the queue without LP loss or LeaveBuster. 

Wait till the tutorial starts and press ESC and Surrender to get back to the client, all done.

Python Version

Requires Python3+ and the 'resquests' module.
I will not cover Python and requests installation here, but it is pretty simple. Google is your friend.

Usage: run from command prompt -> python lol-queue-dodger.py (Only works when LolClient is up!)
Whenever you want to dodge, alt tab to the CMD window and press Enter.

Python Standalone Version

Run the executable and Whenever you want to dodge, alt tab to the CMD window and press Enter.
